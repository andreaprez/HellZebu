# HellZebu

First Person Shooter developed in 10 weeks as a **Degree project**

The objective is to fight against monsters in different arenas as well as to solve platforming puzzles between each arena.
The main feature is that the player has the ability to travel between two opposite worlds (ice and fire), and change enemies from one world to another as well.
